            The Taj Mahal, whose grandeur remains unmatched in history and today
            this is one of the weekend getaways from Delhi. This opulent white
            marble structure was commissioned to be built in 1632 by Shah Jahan
            for his late wife Mumtaz Mahal. It took around 22 years to complete
            this magnificent structure that is considered one of the most famous
            historical places in India.<br /><br />

            According to local legend, it was believed that Shah Jahan cut off
            the hands of all the workers who built the Taj Mahal so that a
            similar monument could not be built.

            One of the famous historical places in India that is built entirely
            of red sandstone. Built in 1565 by Akbar, this historical tourist
            place in India has two ornately designed gates: the Amar Singh Gate
            and the Delhi Gate. You can only enter through the Amar Singh Gate
            to uncover an ancient city filled with gateways, courts, passages,
            palaces and mosques. It is one of the most beautiful places to visit
            in Agra.

            The Red Fort was constructed over ten years from 1638 to 1648. This
            fort was constructed when Shah Jahan shifted the capital from Agra
            to Delhi and it was then known as the Qila-e-Mubarak. This octagonal
            fort is one of the most famous historical places in north India and
            is also the site where the President gives his speech on
            Independence Day. The Red fort is truly remarkable and one of the
            best historical places in India.<br /><br />

            <b>Interesting fact:</b> The Red fort was actually white as it was
            made of limestone. The British painted it red when the limestone
            started chipping off.

            Regarded as the site of the first Muslim kingdom in northern India,
            the Qutub Minar is definitely one of the most historical sites in
            India. It is one of the finest examples of Indo-Muslim architecture
            with its intricate red sandstone storeys. These are dotted with
            carvings and verses from the Quran and are mostly in Arabic and
            Nagari. Qutub Minar is one of the famous historical places in India
            and is said to have got its name from Qutb-ud-din Aibak who was the
            first Muslim ruler of North India. The first mosque in India
            Quwwat-ul-Islam Masjid is also located at the foot of the Qutub
            Minar.<br /><br />
            <b>Interesting fact:</b> The Qutub Minar complex has an iron pillar
            that has not rusted even after 2000 years.

            A beautiful synthesis of Indian and Persian architecture, Humayun’s
            Tomb is one of the most famous and important places in India.
            Humayun’s wife Hamida Banu Begum commissioned the building of this
            tomb for her husband in the 15th century. Arched alcoves, beautiful
            domes, elaborate corridors and kiosks – all make this monument a
            grandeur of Indian architecture. There is also a barber’s tomb at
            the southwestern side of the main tomb. It is one of the most famous
            tourist places in Delhi that one should certainly visit.<br /><br />
            <b>Interesting fact:</b> Humayun’s Tomb was one of the main
            inspirations for the Taj Mahal.

            The royal city of Fatehpur Sikri was once the capital of the Mughal
            era during Akbar’s reign. This royal city is one of the historical
            tourist places in India and once had palaces, public buildings,
            mosques, quarters for the king, the army as well as the servants.
            Further, the well planned royal city with carved columns and
            decorated pillars was built between 1571-1573 AD and abandoned due
            to a shortage of water.<br /><br />
            <b>Interesting fact:</b> Many barren women would come to the tomb of
            the Sufi saint Salim Chisti to pray for children.

            The ‘Palace of Winds’ or Hawa Mahal gets its name due to the fact
            that it looks like a honeycomb of a beehive with its 953 intricate
            windows. It is also shaped like a crown as the ruler who built it,
            Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, was a major devotee of Lord Krishna.
            One of the popular tourist places in Jaipur, this palace is known as
            the tallest building in the world that doesn’t have any foundation.
            The palace is curved but still stands firm due to its pyramidal
            shape.<br /><br />
            <b>Interesting fact:</b> It was believed that this building was
            created so that the royal ladies could look outside as they were
            constantly under ‘purdah’

            Khajuraho has always been thought of as the place that exemplifies
            sensuality and eroticism at its best. However this is a
            misrepresentation as only about 10 percent of the sculptures are
            sensual and the rest are common depictions. Countless sculptures
            depicting love, eternal grace, beauty, delicacy and the creative
            arts can be seen in one of the most historical places in India. A
            perfect amalgamation of Hinduism and Jainism, Khajuraho temples have
            carvings of cult icons, demi gods and Apsaras.<br /><br />
            <b>Interesting fact:</b> The city got its name as it was adorned
            with date palms and “Khajura’ means date palms in Hindi. It was also
            often called Khajjurpura in ancient times.

            Stupa that houses relics of the Buddha. This famous historical place
            in India was built by Lord Asoka in the 3rd century B.C for Emperor
            Ashoka. The Dome of the Stupa signifies the wheel of law and this
            stupa is actually considered as a symbol of Buddha’s freedom the
            circle of life and death (Moksha). The four gateways of the Stupa
            have various scenes from the Jataka tales and stories of Buddha’s
            life.<br /><br />
